#Anomaly Detection in Sheep Behavior Using YOLO-V8 and Faster R-CNN
This project focuses on detecting anomalous behavior in sheep, specifically prolonged sitting activity within video frames. The dataset was collected from Pakistani farms and used to train a model for sheep activity detection. The implementation utilizes a pre-trained model ("best.pt") as the foundation for behavior analysis.
Project Overview
The system incorporates a frontend interface that enables users to:

#Upload video footage for analysis
Process the video through the detection pipeline
Receive output images with tagged anomalies

#Implementation Details

Development timeframe: 2.5 months
Built from the ground up
Includes custom data collection and model training
Features a complete pipeline from input to anomaly detection

#Sample Results
A demonstration video is included showing successful anomaly detection with tagged outputs.
Current Status
While the project demonstrates core functionality, there is potential for further enhancement and optimization. The current implementation serves as a proof of concept for sheep behavior monitoring systems.
